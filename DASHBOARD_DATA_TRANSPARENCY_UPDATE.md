# Dashboard Data Transparency Update

## Changes Made

### 🎯 **Primary Goal**: Prevent Misleading Users with Fake Data

### ✅ **Key Changes**

1. **Default to Real Data Mode**
   - Changed `useLiveData` initial state from `false` to `true`
   - Dashboard now starts by attempting to fetch real data instead of showing sample data

2. **Improved Switch Labels**
   - Changed from "Sample Data" / "Live Data" to "Demo Data" / "Real Data"
   - Makes it clearer which mode shows actual vs simulated data

3. **Added Demo Data Warning**
   - Prominent amber warning banner when demo data is active
   - Clear messaging that data is simulated and not for decision making
   - Warning icon and bold text to grab attention

### 🔍 **User Experience Impact**

**Before:**
- Dashboard showed fake data by default
- Users might unknowingly make decisions based on sample data
- No clear warning about data authenticity

**After:**
- Dashboard attempts to load real data first
- Clear visual distinction between real and demo modes
- Prominent warning when demo data is being used
- Users can't accidentally use fake data for decisions

### 📋 **Warning Message Details**

When demo data is active, users see:
```
⚠️ Demo Data Mode Active

You are currently viewing simulated demo data for demonstration purposes. 
This data is not real and should not be used for actual decision making. 
Switch to "Real Data" mode to view live system data.
```

### 🛡️ **Safety Features**

1. **No Accidental Demo Usage**: Real data is the default
2. **Clear Visual Warnings**: Impossible to miss when using demo data
3. **Explicit Language**: "Demo" vs "Real" instead of "Sample" vs "Live"
4. **Decision Protection**: Warning explicitly states not to use for decisions

### 🚀 **Production Benefits**

- **User Trust**: No risk of users being misled by fake data
- **Data Integrity**: Real data is prioritized
- **Transparency**: Always clear what type of data is being displayed
- **Safety**: Prevents business decisions based on simulated data

This update ensures that the dashboard is production-ready and user-safe, prioritizing real data while still allowing demo mode for training and demonstration purposes.
