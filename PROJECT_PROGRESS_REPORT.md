# Project Progress and Justification: EnCoMPAS

This document outlines the progress of the EnCoMPAS project, demonstrating its relevance and trajectory towards achieving its objectives in rural Ghana.

## 1. Foundational Digital Health Records & Data-Driven Insights

A major achievement is the establishment of a digital health record system where none existed before. This provides a robust foundation for analysis and proactive care.

*   **Total Registrations:** We have successfully registered **661 patients**, creating a valuable dataset for analysis and follow-up.
*   **Geographic Reach:** The project is active in **2 regions** (North East: 357, Upper West: 304), demonstrating scalable reach into rural communities.
*   **Actionable Dashboard Stats:** The main dashboard provides immediate, useful insights that were previously unavailable:
    *   **Registration Trends:** A weekly trend graph shows patient registration patterns, with a notable increase between weeks 32 and 40.
    *   **Age Distribution:** The system automatically calculates patient demographics, showing the largest group is **25-34 years old (48%)**, followed by **18-24 (34%)**. This helps in tailoring health messaging.
*   **Detailed Patient Information:** The system captures critical patient data, including demographics, contact information, and NHIS numbers, creating a comprehensive health profile for each woman.

## 2. Enhanced Field Worker Monitoring & Productivity

The platform provides unprecedented visibility into the activities of Community Health Volunteers (CHVs), allowing for effective performance tracking and management.

*   **Active Contributors:** There are **22 active data capturers** in the field.
*   **Individual Performance:** We can track individual contributions, such as **Abigail Mensah** with **88 entries** and **Ankura Nestor** with **81 entries**. This allows for targeted support, identification of high-performers, and ensures accountability.
*   **Centralized Contacts:** The "Address book" feature allows clinics to maintain a central repository of important hospital and staff contacts, improving coordination.

## 3. Proactive Patient Monitoring & Targeted Health Education

The system enables a shift from reactive to proactive healthcare through automated tracking and targeted communication.

*   **Targeted Messaging:** The platform is already being used to send customized health education via voice SMS. Messages on topics like **"Regular checkups"** and **"Danger signs"** are scheduled for delivery to specific regions. For example, one upcoming message is scheduled for **41 recipients** in the Upper West region.
*   **Improving Patient Engagement:** While the call success rate is currently around **26.4%**, the **Call Delivery Analytics** feature is crucial. It provides the data needed to experiment with different call times and strategies to find the optimal window for reaching women, directly supporting the goal of improving engagement.
*   **Proactive Follow-up:** By tracking ANC schedules, the system allows nurses to identify women who are overdue for visits and proactively contact them, ensuring continuity of care.
